# Car-damage-assessment

[Data wrangling](https://github.com/manasi-mahish/Car-damage-assessment/blob/master/Car%20damage%20Data%20scraping%20and%20analysis.ipynb):
A brief analysis of training data.

[Classification- Damaged vs. Undamaged](https://github.com/manasi-mahish/Car-damage-assessment/blob/master/Car_damaged_vs_undamaged.ipynb):
Here I have classified whether a car is damaged or not using learners built on fastai libraries. 

[Classification- Damage type](https://github.com/manasi-mahish/Car-damage-assessment/blob/master/car_damage_type.ipynb):
Here I have categorized the damage based on its location.

[Prediction from video](https://github.com/manasi-mahish/Car-damage-assessment/blob/master/Car_damage%20video.ipynb):
In this notebook I have created frames from a input video, classify each frame using the pretrained classifier, annotate each frame acoordingly, and finally make a video from those annotated frames. This would be useful for damage assessment, where a user would feed a video of a damaged car as input, and the damage location/extent would be predicted instantly. This can be very beneficial for insurance companies as well as the car owners.
